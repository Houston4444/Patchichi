Patchichi is an abstract JACK patchbay GUI for GNU/Linux systems, but it could be adapted to Mac and Windows with little effort.
The software it most closely resembles is probably Catarina, from the Cadence suite.

It is based on the [HoustonPatchbay](https://github.com/Houston4444/HoustonPatchbay) submodule which provides portgroups, wrappable boxes, editable themes and many other nice features.

The idea here is to have an editable patchbay, totally abstract and not related to the JACK (or PipeWire) audio server.

## Goals:
* Help development of HoustonPatchbay submodule by providing easily and quickly complex patchbays with various types of ports
* Help HoustonPatchbay theme design for the same reasons
* Help debugging users, the idea is to can export a scene from Patchance/RaySession and import it in Patchichi
* Can also be used directly by user to make fastly a patch (for example to explain a guitar pedalboard)
* Yes, it is a niche software ;)
